# Template Install

This repository was created via a template and therefore has placeholder names for the bot. This name should be changed before deploying to ensure that the proper crate name is recognized. To change the name of the bot with respect to the Rust project and the Dockerfile, use [`update_bot_name.py`](./update_bot_name.py). Note that this will _only_ change the default template name `enter_bot_name_here` to the new bot name. It does not act as a generic bot name switcher.
